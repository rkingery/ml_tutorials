    "# Data Wrangling Part 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the series of tutorials on data wrangling. In the first part we started the process of data wrangling on the Titanic dataset, focusing on the EDA aspects. Recall that the point of doing EDA first was to give us a feel of the data. How big the data is; how many samples; how many features; problematic problems like missing values, duplicate samples, and useless features; etc. To see the results of our EDA on the Titatic dataset see that previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next part we'll focus on data cleaning and feature engineering. The goal of data cleaning is to take the messy raw data we have and transform it into quality data that an ML model can train on. The goal of feature engineering is to identify which raw features from the raw data might be useful, and where feasible create potentially useful new derived features from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll continue on with the example Titanic dataset from before. Since the plan is to do data cleaning, feature engineering, and (finally) train a working model, I'll go ahead and load numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and various sklearn and imblearn functions we covered before for imbalanced classification. I'll also specify a seed since randomness will be used in this code, and finally port over a useful function I've used in prior tutorials for printing out various metrics during model training."

    "Focusing on the Titanic dataset again, I'll again import the data from the URL below, verify that the output is what was expected, and drop the `PassengerId` column since EDA identified it as a useless feature (a duplicate index). Recall that the ultimate goal here is to build a model that can predict whether a passenger of the Titanic survived, given the other features present in this dataset.\n",

    "Now, let's start by cleaning up the non-string columns since they're the easiest to deal with. Going in left-to-right order, we first have the `Survived` column, which will end up being the labels for the ML problem. From the EDA, we know that there are no missing values here, and that the values are already encoded as binary integers with `0 = not survived` and `1 = survived`. That means this column is already good and we can move on.\n",

The fact that `Pclass` is categorical means that there is no (far as we can tell) no natural ordering. With categorical data, it wouldn't make sense to say `1 < 2 < 3`. It would make about as much sense as saying `red < blue < orange`. We thus may want to encode this data differently, e.g. one-hot encodings or embeddings. I'll ignore this for now and come back to it later. Other than this issue, this column appears good to go as well.\n",

    "Let's address the missing value question first. With missing values present in a column you generally have a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop the rows with missing values in that column. We could do this, and it may make since if there or only a handful missing. But 177 is a lot (almost 20% of the data). Dropping 20% of the data just doesn't seem like a great idea.\n",
    "2. Impute the missing values with an agreed upon value. But what value? We could just pick something random like 0 or -1 or 999 or whatever, but then we skew the distribution since this feature is continuous. A better idea would be to impute it with some kind of average value in the feature distribution, e.g. the column's mean, median, or mode. This is equivalent to saying \"I don't know what this value is, and without any better info my best guess is the average from that column\".\n",
    "3. Build a model to learn what to impute with. That is, you train a model that can take in as an example a row containing all features but that feature with missing values, and try to predict what that missing value should be,  given what the values in the other features are. This can be thought of as building a prior, where you ask \"what is my best guess for this missing value, given that I know what the values in the other features are for this example\". You can get a smarter imputer this way. However, it can be time consuming to build such a model, and the gains usually aren't helpful enough in practice to justify the effort. If you're interested in an easier way to do this, checkout sklearn's imputation approaches [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, and because it's the most common way to deal with missing values in practice, I'll go with approach (2) for this tutorial. It's also become useful to create a *new* binary feature to keep track of *which* values in a given column are missing. The reason is that there may in fact be some information in the fact that those values are missing, and maybe this is information the ML model might find useful in learning to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the `Age` column, we can fill in missing values with a fixed value using the `df.fillna` method. I'll fill in the missing values with the *mean* age of 29.699 years. Doing this, we can see that there are no no missing values in that column. Also note a consequence of imputing with the mean is that the mean of that column won't change. Why? Adding more values of the mean to a dataset never changes the mean (prove it). It *will* affect the spread of the data though, making it generally go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice I also create the new feature `Age_missing`, which is a binary feature where `0 = not missing` and `1 = missing`. I'll do this for every missing value column below as well. It's also good to check that `Age_missing` does indeed have 177 `1` values as well."

The reason is you often have a set of metrics thresholds indicating what's \"good enough\". Once you reach those thresholds, it often doesn't matter in a practical sense whether you can improve results. It's \"good enough\" and you can move onto other things."

    "Since this is a random forest, we can also look at the feature importances to see if the model makes sense. It appears the model treats `Sex` as by far the most important feature in deciding whether somebody survived, which from our previous EDA makes a lot of sense. Females were far more likely to survive than males. After `Sex`, it seems both `Fare` and `Pclass` were about equally important. This makes sense as well. We'd expect wealthier folks (who often pay more for better tickets and better amenities) to be more likely to survive than poorer folks."

    "One pattern appears very clear in those who survived vs didn't: Those with titles like `Mr.` or `Master.` seem less likely to have survived than those with titles like `Mrs.` or `Miss.`. This is yet another reminder that survival on the Titanic strongly correlated with sex, something we already saw above in the baseline model. \n",

    "But, there may be something else to keeping these titles and making features out of them. So let's do that. I'm going to take the `Name` column and extract out of it a new column `Titles`. Let's first write some code to extract out the title for each column, and then show the value counts of those, so we can see which titles are worth keeping vs lumping together into a `Rare` group.\n",

As most rows won't have a prefix, most of the time the value will be `Other`. But enough rows *do* have another value that there should be enough information in this column to use. This is *not* to say it'll do any good with improving the model, but it's something to try and see."
