    "# End-to-End ML (Part 2): Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second part of the series of tutorials on data wrangling. In the first part we started the process of data wrangling on the Titanic dataset, focusing on the EDA aspects. Recall that the point of doing EDA first was to give us a feel of the data. How big the data is; how many samples; how many features; problematic problems like missing values, duplicate samples, and useless features; etc. To see the results of our EDA on the Titatic dataset see that previous tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next part we'll focus on data cleaning and feature engineering. The goal of data cleaning is to take the messy raw data we have and transform it into quality data that an ML model can train on. The goal of feature engineering is to identify which raw features from the raw data might be useful, and where feasible create potentially useful new derived features from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll continue on with the example Titanic dataset from before. Since the plan is to do data cleaning, feature engineering, and (finally) train a working model, I'll go ahead and load numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and various sklearn and imblearn functions we covered before for imbalanced classification. I'll also specify a seed since randomness will be used in this code, and finally port over a useful function I've used in prior tutorials for printing out various metrics during model training."

    "Now, let's start by cleaning up the non-string columns since they're the easiest to deal with. Going in left-to-right order, we first have the `Survived` column, which will end up being the labels for the ML problem. From the EDA, we know that there are no missing values here, and that the values are already encoded as binary integers with `0 = not survived` and `1 = survived`. That means this column is already good and we can move on.\n",

    "The next column is `Pclass`. Recall that `Pclass` takes on the integer values `1, 2, 3`. It has no missing values. And it is evidently a categorical variable representing what boarding class the passenger was in. The fact that `Pclass` is categorical means that there is no (far as we can tell) no natural ordering. With categorical data, it wouldn't make sense to say `1 < 2 < 3`. It would make about as much sense as saying `red < blue < orange`. We thus may want to encode this data differently, e.g. one-hot encodings or embeddings. I'll ignore this for now and come back to it later. Other than this issue, this column appears good to go as well.\n",

    "The next non-string column is `Sex`. Recall that this column (as the name implies) represents passenger sex, and is encoded as `male`, `female`. This feature is obviously categorical. There are no missing values in this column. To deal with the encodings, I'll for now map `0 = male` and `1 = female`, though we may want to use a different categorical encoding later."

    "Let's address the missing value question first. With missing values present in a column you generally have a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop the rows with missing values in that column. We could do this, and it may make since if there or only a handful missing. But 177 is a lot (almost 20% of the data). Dropping 20% of the data just doesn't seem like a great idea.\n",
    "2. Impute the missing values with an agreed upon value. But what value? We could just pick something random like 0 or -1 or 999 or whatever, but then we skew the distribution since this feature is continuous. A better idea would be to impute it with some kind of average value in the feature distribution, e.g. the column's mean, median, or mode. This is equivalent to saying \"I don't know what this value is, and without any better info my best guess is the average from that column\".\n",
    "3. Build a model to learn what to impute with. That is, you train a model that can take in as an example a row containing all features but that feature with missing values, and try to predict what that missing value should be,  given what the values in the other features are. This can be thought of as building a prior, where you ask \"what is my best guess for this missing value, given that I know what the values in the other features are for this example\". You can get a smarter imputer this way. However, it can be time consuming to build such a model, and the gains usually aren't helpful enough in practice to justify the effort. If you're interested in an easier way to do this, checkout sklearn's imputation approaches [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, and because it's the most common way to deal with missing values in practice, I'll go with approach (2) for this tutorial. It's also become useful to create a *new* binary feature to keep track of *which* values in a given column are missing. The reason is that there may in fact be some information in the fact that those values are missing, and maybe this is information the ML model might find useful in learning to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the `Age` column, we can fill in missing values with a fixed value using the `df.fillna` method. I'll fill in the missing values with the *mean* age of 29.699 years. Doing this, we can see that there are no no missing values in that column. Also note a consequence of imputing with the mean is that the mean of that column won't change. Why? Adding more values of the mean to a dataset never changes the mean (prove it). It *will* affect the spread of the data though, making it generally go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice I also create the new feature `Age_missing`, which is a binary feature where `0 = not missing` and `1 = missing`. I'll do this for every missing value column below as well. It's also good to check that `Age_missing` does indeed have 177 `1` values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After imputing missing values we'll go ahead and normalize the column as well by dividing by the max age."

    "\n",
    "What we'll first do then is take those columns and build our inputs from those, using those to train what we'll call a **baseline** model. A baseline is a quick, dirty model done with minimal work that can tell you how well you can do without trying to hard. The baseline is often the first model you want to try to beat. If the baseline is good enough, no need to waste time on more feature engineering or model iterations. If not, you can go from there."

    "\n",
    "Note that in defining the training and test data I do it slightly different here than usual. Instead of splitting the training and test data directly, I instead split on their indexes and then index them out to get the data. The reason I do this is because we'll train more models on different features below, and it's good to do an objective comparison between the different approaches. If you sample different training and test data at each iteration, you don't necessarily know if one set of models is better than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** That said, there's a caveat. You *must* be cognizant of the fact that it's easy to overfit your test set this way if you're not careful. Reason being you're training a bunch of models, tweaking the data, training a bunch more models, etc. When you do that it's easy to accidentally overfit your test set because you find yourself optimizing on test set metrics and pumping them up. Thus, be careful when you do this. It may be good practice to hold out a third *validation set* if you wish to do extensive data and model tuning like I'm doing here. Tune on the validation set, and only evaluate against your test set at the very very end."

    "**Note:** In real life ML engineering, depending on business objectives and priorities, you might stop here and opt not to continue to feature engineer or improve the models. The reason is you often have a set of metrics thresholds indicating what's \"good enough\". Once you reach those thresholds, it often doesn't matter in a practical sense whether you can improve results. It's \"good enough\" and you can move onto other things. Odds are that all the feature engineering we're about to do will only improve the models by a percent or two (if even that), meaning you should really justify to yourself if the considerable extra development effort (both training and production) is worth it to you before doing so. It may make sense in research or in Kaggle where you're trying to hit a state of the art, but in most other cases other priorities are often as or more important than your model metrics. Think carefully.\n",

    "One pattern appears very clear in those who survived vs didn't: Those with titles like `Mr.` or `Master.` seem less likely to have survived than those with titles like `Mrs.` or `Miss.`. This is yet another reminder that survival on the Titanic strongly correlated with sex, something we already saw above in the baseline model. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, there may be something else to keeping these titles and making features out of them. So let's do that. I'm going to take the `Name` column and extract out of it a new column `Titles`. Let's first write some code to extract out the title for each column, and then show the value counts of those, so we can see which titles are worth keeping vs lumping together into a `Rare` group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I'll extract titles is by using the regular expression (\"regex\") string `' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.'`. If you're not familiar with regexes, this particular regex string says to take the input string from `Name`, match with any substring that\n",

After matching with substrings of this form, the regex will extract the alphabetical text *before* the period, and then show that (which we'll eventually dump into a new `Titles` column).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the value counts, we can see that the set of titles `Mr, Miss, Mrs, Master` all occur over 10 times in the dataset, and the rest look to be rare. We'll map all of these rare titles into their own `Rare` title class and keep the rest separately."

    "Before moving on, let's look at the logistic regression model's feature importances again to see if anything is different now. It looks like `Age`, `Sex`, and `Fare` are still important features, but some of the new one-hot features snuck in too. The top handful of new features appear to be `Prefix_4` (i.e. tickets with a `STON/O` prefix), `Title_3` (people title \"Master\", i.e. young boys), and `Title_0` (people title \"Mr\", i.e. older men). Since these two title features clearly correlate with `Sex` and `Age`, they're likely diminishing the true importance of the `Sex` `Age ` features as predictors of survival."

The path we'll save to is `../resources/titanic_cleaned.csv`. Note that we won't actually use this saved file in the next tutorial, instead just importing our preprocessing as a function."

    "It looks like the LR onehot model is on the whole doing the best across all metrics. This suggests we should choose this model, right? Well, perhaps not. It turns out that the above scores are *very* sensitive to the choice of seed. I deliberately picked a seed (123) that gives \"high\" accuracies of 85-86%. Most other seeds will actually give lower accuracies, usually somewhere in the 79-86% range. Try changing the seed at the top of the notebook to a different number and re-running if you don't believe me! It'll almost certainly give much lower scores across the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our metrics have uncertainties on the order of 5% like this depending which seed we choose, how do we know which model is truly \"best\"? After all, in ML we usually want a model that works best on *all unseen* data, not particular \"lucky\" subsets of the data. The reason we're having this problem is because our dataset is \"small\". That may seem surprising, given that it has 891 examples, but *relative to the task* it's quite small. Predicting survival from this dataset turns out to be a surprisingly noisy task, which means to get stable, accurate estimates we'd need a lot more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we do about this problem, given that we can't exactly get more Titanic data? The trick is to use model selection techniques like K-fold cross validation. These techniques will allow us to work better with small-ish, noisy data like Titanic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next tutorial, we'll use model selection techniques to help pick out the best model to use. We'll also talk a little bit about so-called ML Ops and how to deploy a simple Titanic survival prediction model to \"production\"."
